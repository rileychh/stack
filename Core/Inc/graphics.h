 * @brief  Header for black and white graphics library.
 * @sa     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham's_line_algorithm">Bresenham's line algorithm on Wikipedia</a>
 * @details
 *
 * A graphics library for black and white graphic LCDs.  Supports lines, rectangles and text.
 *
 * Fonts are available separately in header files, see the fonts/ directory.
 *
 * This requires a hardware driver for the GLCD that provides a glcd_pixel() routine.  See
 * my ST7565 library for an example.
 *
 * The benefit of this approach is that it can be ported easily to any graphic LCD.  However,
 * speed benefits could be gained by writing routines that draw whole bytes at a time.
 *
 * Fonts and graphics can be converted from Windows TTF fonts or images using the muGUI
 * "Font and Bitmap Generator", which is free.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code
 *    // Draw some text with spacing 1, at location (10,10)
 *    draw_text("Example string", 10, 10, Tahoma10, 1);
 *
 *    // Draw a rectangle from (1,1) to (50,50)
 *    draw_rectangle(1, 1, 50, 50, 1);
 *
 *    // Draw a circle, centred at (32,32) with radius 10
 *    draw_circle(32, 32, 10, 1);
 * @endcode
